# Host_specificity_code
Code adapted from Abram et al (2021) to provide a quantitative measure of parasitoid taxonomic specifcity.

Presented alongside poster "Understanding generalism and specialism in parasitoid wasps: Aleiodes (Braconidae) as a case study" at the International Society of Hymentopterists 10th Congress at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Iasi, Romania, July 2023. This poster won 1st prize in the student poster category.
